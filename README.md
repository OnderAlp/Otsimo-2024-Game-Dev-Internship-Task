# Otsimo 2024 Game Dev Internship Task
Unity Assignment for Otsimo Game Dev Intern Task 2024. Made by Önder Alp Civcir.

This is my implementation of the task I received at oac.09cnc@gmail.com

I uploaded the APK file of the project into the Releases.

Project developed for Android. All requirements of the project have been completed. Added extras like;
<ul>
<li> ColorWheel: Create and reuse your own colors, </li>
<li> Size Slider: Determine the size of tools, </li>
<li> Painting Cannon: Fire colored projectiles onto the canvas and create paint explosions, </li>
<li> Added sound effects for better user experience, </li>
<li> Calming background music .</li>
</ul>

For a better user experience, I focused on adding extra features. <br/>
Thank you for reviewing the project.
