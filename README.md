# Otsimo 2024 Game Dev Internship Task
Unity Assignment for Otsimo Game Dev Intern Task 2024. Made by Ã–nder Alp Civcir.

This is my implementation of the task I received at oac.09cnc@gmail.com

I uploaded the APK file of the project into the Releases.

Project developed for Android. All requirements of the project have been completed. Added extras like;
ColorWheel: Create and reuse your own colors,
Size Slider: Determine the size of tools,
Painting Cannon: Fire colored projectiles onto the canvas and create paint explosions,
Added responsive sound effects,
Calming background music.

To improve the project, I worked to add extra features and further enhance the user experience.
Thank you for reviewing the project.
